## Changing costume

Hmm, this would look better if the cat sprite changed direction when it turns left. 



+ Click on 'Costumes' and delete the 'cat1 flying-a' costume.

+ Rename the remaining costume from 'cat1 flying-b' to 'right'.

+ Right-click on the costume and choose duplicate to create a copy.

+ Click 'Flip left-right' to reverse the copy and then name it 'left'. 

	Your costumes should look like this:

+ Click 'Scripts' to return to your code and add blocks to change the costume when the direction is changed.
