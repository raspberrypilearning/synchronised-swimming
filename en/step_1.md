## Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to use loops and cloning to create a fun synchronised swimming routine. 

This project uses sound. If you don't have access to sound then Step 4 can be skipped without affecting the rest of the project. 

## 2016 Summer Olympics
This project has been created to celebrate the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio. 

## Resources

The instructions for this project can be found at [jumpto.cc/swim](http://jumpto.cc/swim).

## Learning Objectives
+ Repetition (the `repeat`{:class="blockcontrol"} block).

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

## Challenges
+ "Code your own routine" - Use `repeat`{:class="blockcontrol"} code blocks to program a swimming routine;
+ "Change the team" - Change the number of swimmers in the team by changing the number and position of the clones that are created.
